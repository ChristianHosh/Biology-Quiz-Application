# Biology Quiz Application
  Welcome to Biology Trivia Helper, an Android app designed to assist elementary school students in learning Biology through fun and engaging 
  trivia questions. This app was created as a solo project for a university assignment and provides a simple and easy-to-navigate UI with dark 
  colors that are appropriate for school students. Biology Trivia Helper uses Java entity classes to hold the data and Mockup data objects to store 
  the information. The app currently has two activities and provides feedback and encouragement to keep children motivated. The content is 
  age-appropriate and aligned with elementary school Biology curriculum.
  
  I'm also looking forward to updating it with a leaderboard and a subject selection activity.

  <li>Add more subjects other than biology</li>
  <li>Use an API to get the trivia questions instead of hardcoding them</li>
</ul>
